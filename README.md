# SQL Sales Analysis – Product Revenue Breakdown

This project analyzes product sales data using SQL in Google BigQuery and visualizes the average ticket per product in Google Sheets.

## Highlights:
- Calculated total sales, total revenue, and average ticket per product.
- Used SQL functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `ROUND`, and `GROUP BY` to process and structure the data.
- Created a clear and visual chart to present insights on product performance.

## Key Insight:
Smartphones had the highest average ticket, reinforcing the trend that mobile devices are no longer just tools – they’ve become an extension of the modern user.

## Files:
- `Average Ticket Per Product.pdf` – Chart visual (Google Sheets)  
- `average_ticket_result.csv` – Exported query result
